# Audio-Classification

This is a small introduction into the use of tensorflow models for me, with the help of [Nicholas Renotte](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasRenotte). And unexpectedly I discover a technique to transform audio data into images that allow me to apply CNN model into the task.

I also gained insight of an average ML model building flow, from data preparation to model evaluation and exporting the result.
